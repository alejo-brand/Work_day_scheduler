# Work_day_scheduler

In this app I develop a work day scheduler that allows the user to organize their work day on a 9am to 5pm schedule.

the past hour time slots will be colored in grey, the current hour will be colored in red and the hours to come will be colored in green.

on each time slot, the user will be able to type all the activities they want to schedule for that specific time and save changes in the browser local storage.

Everytime that the user clicks the save button, it will cause that the app will save all the content provided in the text area for that specific hour, but the information saved will remain displayed in the text area even if the user refreshes the browser page.

below you can find a sample of the deployed application.
